        <p>
            Started from Mid-late March 2020, lockdown restrictions progressively implemented by Australian government
            to restrict citizensâ€™ movements and reduce their opportunities to gather with other people outside their
            household. International and national border measures for some states and territories introduced.
            This study aims to investigate the environmental and air quality changes with the reference of before
            COVID-19 lockdown in Australia. In total, six Earth Observation (EO) parameters, namely Land surface
            temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Built-up Index
            (NDBI), Carbon monoxide (CO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Aerosols (AOD), were derived from Google Earth
            Engine (GEE) cloud platform for two periods of November 2019 - March 2020 and November 2020- March 2021.
            Statistics and spatial Machine Learning were performed to examine the changes of the six parameters at
            national, regional, and local level across the whole Australia. Nationwide changes were found in reduced
            temperature, increased NDVI and improved air quality. Regionally, most of the capital cities and the rural
            regions showed decrease in temperature except Greater Melbourne and Greater Darwin. For air quality, both
            capital cities and the rural areas showed decrease in AOD and CO level but increase in NO2 in southeast
            areas of Australia. Most of the capital cities experienced increased LST but decreased NDVI, indicating more
            vulnerability towards heat. In contrast, Hobart, Canberra and all the regional areas showed enhanced heat
            resilience. Finally, five clustering zones for local communities across the country were delineated with
            similar environmental and air quality changes using spatially constrained multivariate machine learning.
            This study demonstrates multi-scale analysis capabilities of Earth Observation and spatial machine learning
            to investigate the spatial and temporal variations of the environmental and air quality changes as a whole.
